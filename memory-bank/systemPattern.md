# System Patterns

## Architecture Pattern
- Serverless First Architecture: Using Lambda, S3, and managed services
- Microservices Pattern: Separate services for auth, document processing, chat, voice
- Event-Driven Architecture: Using SNS/SQS for asynchronous processing
- CQRS for chatbot: Separate query and command responsibilities

## Data Patterns
- Document Store: Amazon S3 for raw document storage
- Vector Database: For semantic search capabilities
- DynamoDB: For user data, permissions, and configurations
- Cache Layers: For frequently accessed data

## Frontend Patterns
- Server Components: Leveraging Next.js 14+ server components
- Client-Side State Management: React Context + SWR for data fetching
- Component-Based Design: Reusable UI components with clear responsibilities
- Progressive Enhancement: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Security Patterns
- Zero Trust Architecture: Verify everything, trust nothing
- Principle of Least Privilege: IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Defense in Depth: Multiple security layers (WAF, CORS, input validation)
- OWASP Top 10 Mitigation: Addressing common web vulnerabilities

## Integration Patterns
- API Gateway Pattern: Centralized API management
- Webhook Pattern: For Stripe and Twilio integrations
- Circuit Breaker: For resilient external service calls
- Adapter Pattern: For consistent interfaces across services

## Deployment Patterns
- Infrastructure as Code: Using AWS CDK or CloudFormation
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment
- Feature Toggles: For controlled feature rollout
- Blue/Green Deployments: For zero-downtime updates
