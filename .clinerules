# Project Rules and Patterns

## AWS Best Practices
- Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Implement least privilege IAM roles
- Use infrastructure as code for all resources
- Implement proper tagging for resource management

## Development Workflows
- Use feature branches with pull requests
- Require code review before merging
- Run comprehensive tests in CI pipeline
- Use semantic versioning for releases

## Architecture Decisions
- Prefer serverless components where possible
- Use event-driven architecture for asynchronous processes
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning

## Code Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use ESLint for code quality enforcement
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Document all public APIs and key functions

## Security Requirements
- Store no sensitive data in code repositories
- Use Secrets Manager for credentials
- Implement proper input validation on all endpoints
- Configure WAF for API Gateway protection

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize Lambda function packages for size
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize database access patterns
- Use CloudFront for static asset delivery
